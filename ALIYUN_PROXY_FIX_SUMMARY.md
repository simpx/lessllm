# Aliyun Proxy Issue Resolution Summary

## Problem Identified
The issue was not with authentication (which we had already fixed), but with the endpoint URL format. The Aliyun Claude proxy requires requests to be sent to the `/v1/messages` endpoint, just like the official Anthropic API.

## Root Cause
Our implementation was sending requests to:
```
https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/api/v2/apps/claude-code-proxy
```

But the correct endpoint should be:
```
https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/api/v2/apps/claude-code-proxy/v1/messages
```

## Solution Implemented
1. **Fixed the base provider** (`lessllm/providers/base.py`):
   - Modified `get_endpoint_url()` method to append `/v1/messages` for Aliyun proxy URLs
   - This ensures all providers using the Aliyun proxy will use the correct endpoint

2. **Updated test files** to use the correct endpoint format:
   - `test_httpx_client.py`
   - `test_requests.py`
   - `test_exact_body.py`
   - `test_various.py`

## Verification Results
All tests now pass successfully:
- ✅ LessLLM framework with Aliyun proxy
- ✅ Direct HTTPX client requests
- ✅ Direct requests library requests
- ✅ Official Anthropic library
- ✅ Environment variable configuration

## Key Differences from Original Implementation
1. **Endpoint URL**: Added `/v1/messages` suffix for Aliyun proxy URLs
2. **No functional changes** to authentication or request body format
3. **Backward compatibility** maintained for standard Anthropic API URLs

## Files Modified
1. `lessllm/providers/base.py` - Fixed endpoint URL generation
2. Multiple test files - Updated URLs to match new format

This fix ensures that LessLLM can now work seamlessly with the Aliyun Claude proxy while maintaining compatibility with the official Anthropic API.
